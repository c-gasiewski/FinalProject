# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Dinosaur Dichotomous Key

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This project is a scientific tool that will allow the user to identify a dinosaur based on its physical attributes.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software is meant to identify dinosaurs based on their physical attributes. It will include various questions that will lead the user to a specific dinosaur using a predetermined question set. This set will be presented with use of for loops and/or elseif statements. We will create the program and Visual Studio Code using python. It will be visualized using RenPy.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Maya Manders, maya.manders@temple.edu, Xinwen Zhang
Ryan Kempner, ryan.kempner@temple.edu, Xinwen Zhang

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for our final project would be a basic dichotomous key for at least commonly known dinosaurs from one of the three periods

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline

A great outcome would be having commonly dinosaurs from all three periods.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be having most if not all dinosaurs across all three periods within our dichotomous key.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps for us include: figuring out how much we reasonably can get done, researching dichotomous keys, researching dinosaurs we want to include, and what period(s) we want to pull from. We also need to design a question set for the key itself. A new skill we need to acquire is to be able to use RenPy effectively in order to better illustrate our dichotomous key. As a group of three, we will split up creating questions, choosing dinosaurs and coding evenly.
